# Cookies

A cookie is a small piece of information thatâ€™s stored at the client, originally sent
from the server through an HTTP response message. Every time the client sends an
HTTP request to the server, the cookie is sent along with it. Cookies are designed to
overcome the stateless-ness of HTTP.
