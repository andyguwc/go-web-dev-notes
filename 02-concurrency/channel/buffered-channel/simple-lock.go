/* Buffered Channel
If a channel has received a value, and then sent another one before the channel can be read, the second operation will block
so we need a buffered channel 


Using channel as a lock
1 A function acquires a lock by sending a message on a channel.
2 The function proceeds to do its sensitive operations.
3 The function releases the lock by reading the message back off the channel.
4 Any function that tries to acquire the lock before itâ€™s been released will pause
when it tries to acquire the (already locked) lock.
